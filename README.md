When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
If you want people to read a lot of text on your page, however,  then too much contrast can make it harder to read, too. 
low Contrast
high Contrast
medium Contrast
If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font to make it easier to read.
For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
You can reduce contrast by using dark gray text on a white background or an off-white text on a dark background
The rule for the <h1> element sets the color of the heading using a hex code. There are two values for the background-color property of the <h1> element. The first provides a fallback color using a hex code and the second is an HSLA value for browsers that support this method.
Each paragraph is then shown in a different color to represent the varying levels of acidity or alkalinity, and these are specified using RGB values.
